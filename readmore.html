        <h3>Astrophysicist!</h3>
        <p>
       Through my work as a professional astrophysicist, I discovered my passion for data science, machine learning, and scientific interpretation and prediction. As a postdoc I have extended this to a far-reaching expertise across astronomy and astrophysics focusing on data science applications in gravitational-wave astronomy. 

Ultimately, my passion for data science encourages me to explore all options and I am very eager to apply my analysis and machine learning skills to real-world problems in industry and everywhere. 

My international experience brings a wholesome and compassionate perspective to data science that focuses on team-oriented and independent problem solving. 
Mentoring colleagues and students and collaborating on projects is a constant area of growth in my career; currently I lead/co-lead 7 collaborative projects, where 4 of them involve novel machine learning applications to real-world datasets. 

Some main current projects include:

1. Deep learning for classification of black hole datasets with autoencoders in PyTorch and clustering algorithms in Sci-kit Learn,
2. Core development of a new framework for optimized inverse-Bayesian sampling with simulation-based calibration applied to highly complex datasets,
3. Image classification of supernova remnant datasets which are sparsely populated, requiring advanced computer vision techniques
4. Graph theoretic applications of Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs for learning and regression of noisy, high-dimensional datasets 

In all of my works and projects, I utilize high performance computing architecture via Slurm and/or HTCondor, and I employ workflows based on Agile methodologies with reproducibility and development control via Github/Gitlab and containerization via Singularity/Docker. My preferred operating system is Linux/Unix but often also work on MacOS and Windows. 

I am a member of the LIGO and LISA collaborations and have worked on LIGO data pipelines. 

My work attracts students and collaborators from around the world, and I am constantly learning new tools and software to improve my analysis abilities. <br>
